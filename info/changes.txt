A (probably) comprehensive list of changes that differ from the original Windows 10

Minor:
- There's 3 panels per app non-label mode on apps, windows has 2.
- Previews has the option to hover slightly above the taskbar instead
- Closing previews in list-form animates
- Middle mouse button on titlebar closes the window

Major:
- Bring back the All Programs from Windows 7, change a bit of how Start works
