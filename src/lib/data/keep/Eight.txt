I've been finding myself playing out various scenarios and conversations in my head as of late
"no shit, what would this be otherwise?"

Yeah, yes, I know, that's the exact same reason I'm writing these, to archive these weird thoughts that come at night and don't let me sleep. Won't let me sleep, and if I start writing down something, it's likely enough to get me sleepy enough so the truly horrifying thoughts don't get enough time to settle in.

But I digress, it's interesting to see these thoughts that spring up late at night, even if sometimes I have to distract myself from them by writing here. I never quite thought I was capable of this amount of creativity, and I never thought that I'd reach the point of absolute loneliness needed to resort to conversations with myself.

On one hand, the people in my mind can be as interesting as I make them, last as long as I remember them, and... well, they're just as good as a conversationalist as me. And I'm a pretty good smooth talker.

On the other hand, I don't have a very good memory. Keyword on remember, these people fade out of existence when my mind's garbage collector runs. When the sun shines upon my eyes and a new dawn is due, my mind prepares for the real-life day at hand... and consequently, takes away the scraps of my imagination, my escape, or, how it sometimes feels like, my little cage.

It's just extremely depressing to think about it. I don't feel bad for the people I've left behind, I know I was a passing light in their lives. I don't think it's sad when someone parts, but it's truly sad when you stay long enough to see them part, for real, forever. And I'm experiencing this everyday now. There's no soothing feeling of having impacted someone, wherever they may be. I meet someone, in my mind, and the next day, they die. They don't continue existing. And they sprung into existence merely because of me. So, in a way, I am their murderer.

And it makes me want to cry, with these dried eyes.
