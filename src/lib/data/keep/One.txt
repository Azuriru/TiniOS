- Hello?
- hey, how was your day?
- Oh, good! I've gotten quite a few calls today. How about you?
- well, I'd rather not answer. Just calling to check up on you, have some smalltalk. Though I've also got a question, do you think even the closest minded people can change their mind?
- Of course, sir, I just think it's a matter for the right person to get through to them. Anyone can be set on the right track with some perseverance!
- i dunno about that right path stuff, but perhaps you're right. Just a matter of attention. Hey, you're working, right?
- Well it's more like a volunteer job but yeah haha, it's quite interesting the people you meet here.
- that's good, I haven't met anyone interesting in a while, though that may be because I haven't had a job for a few weeks. Oh well, it's not all bad, I guess. Have you heard about Banksy? 
- Rings a bell, but no, sir, I don't
- it's some street artist, I like his work, but one quote's just stuck to me like a bad smell. "They say you die twice, once, when your heart stops beating. And another time, a bit later on, when someone remembers your name for last time."
- It's beautiful, would you mind telling me more about his work?
- well, I don't think I've got the time, and that's the only one I memorized anyway. I've only got a few minutes of credit left on this number too. Hey, do they let you guys share your names in this suicide hotline stuff?
- We reserve the right to use any personally identifiable information to report to the police, but we've got no restrictions on how to protect callers. My name's Sonia
- wonderful name. Well, there's nothing to protect. I just wanted to experience this for myself, that's the only thing we take out of this life anyways. Sonia, right? It's been lovely talking, but I'll be taking my leave. Have a good afternoon. Oh, and of course, I used to be called-

— hang —
