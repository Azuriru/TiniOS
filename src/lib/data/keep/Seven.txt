Why would I feel sorry for you? I mean, you got what you wanted, right? That feeling is just your own choices weighing down on you, and everyone has to deal with the same thing. I don't pity you, I'm happy you can still choose for yourself. Or, if you really want to word it more pessimistically, put the blame on yourself.
