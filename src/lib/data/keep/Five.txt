- ... there you are. What are you doing out here in the forest, hidden like that? You got me all worried!
- Go away, I'm not ready to go back yet.
- But it's getting late, and dinner's almost ready. You're not going to miss out, are you?
- I need some time to think, if I go back now, nothing good's gonna come out of it
- Oh, come on, you can't blow every single little fight out of proportion like that, you need to move on
- I know that, I know that better than anybody else! I can move on, just... give me time
