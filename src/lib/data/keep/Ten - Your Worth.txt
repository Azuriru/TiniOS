This one ties together with selfishness and how you perceive others relative to yourself

What are you worth? I mean, your organs are probably worth a fair bit, could make a quick buck if you really wanted to. But that's not what I'm talking about. You know, in the same way that your old Nintendo console is worth something to you beyond its monetary value

Not considering that it's probably not really worth shit at this point

It's a measure of how much something really "matters" to someone. You, usually, and there are lots of things that matter. Some way more than others, like your pet, your family, your partner, and of course, your PlayStation 2

So, what is your worth? Well, who are you considering? You're probably worth a lot to the people to interact with daily. You're relied on in your family circle, your partner would feel empty without you, and you're your pet's world. And you don't want your consoles collecting dust with no one to play them

This leads us to some interesting conclusions, like the fact that your worth is entirely dependent on others. So you never really know what it is, because you don't know what they think. And more often than not, they couldn't put it into words even if you asked them. Especially if they're a dog, or a console

So you can think about it as a cool thought experiment and consider what would happen if you were gone, but you can never back any of it up, not really

You will never know your true impact on others, only really catch a few glimpses

So the next time you think you're worthless, well

Who the fuck are you to say that? That's others' jobs to decide, not you. To each person, you're worth something different. Not any less or more, just a different flavor of impact.
