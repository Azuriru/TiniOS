As you may probably know already, looks aren't everything. Obviously, even the most attractive husk of a female wouldn't make a very good girlfriend if you can't actually make any good conversations or even tolerate its personality. Still, though, there's gotta be *some* attraction to eachother to hold things together, and that may be easier said than done

Of course, you can just date someone beautiful, with a great personality, that you can easily spend the rest of your life with. If you do, excellent, you can leave now. But most of us aren't that lucky, so we need to improvise.

Surprisingly enough, a pretty good way to be attracted to someone is to actually fucking fall in love with them. No, I'm not kidding; you never plan to fall in love with someone, and when you do, it's never expected (as much as hindsight may lie to you, there was no way you could see it coming).

Oftentimes, you talk to someone a lot, disregarding their appearance. You may see them as not very good-looking, but neither do you care, they make for good conversation nonetheless (unless they're too hideous to ignore, in which case, you may have bigger problems on your hands).

This is great, because there may not be many people with attractive bodies or faces and charming personalities, but you can have much better chances by just finding someone compatible with you that you don't mind so much how they look. And, if by chance you do end up falling for them, you'll find nearly every single detail about them attractive in some way, one that is indescribable.
