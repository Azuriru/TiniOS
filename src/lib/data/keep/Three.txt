- I've had so much fun today!
- Yeah, me too
- I'm glad to hear it, it turned night before I even noticed. Tell me, do you have WhatsApp?
- Yeah, I do
- Oh, sweet! Would you give me your number?
- Nah
- Oh... why not?
- Well, nothing about privacy or against you really. I just don't really want to keep talking after today. I haven't been conditioned to
- Excuse me, what? Conditioned?
- Yeah, like Stockholm's syndrome.
- What's that?
- It's like, when someone is captured and falls in love with their kidnapper, or grows attached to them. That kind of feeling. I haven't spent years of my life forced to get along with you and neither have you messaged me everyday for a few years for me to start depending on it.
- That's... kind of a harsh way of living, don't you think? Why won't you give others a chance to enter your life?
- Oh, I'm not stopping them. There's just quite a high barrier of entry, I guess. If a relationship can be sustained without the clinginess attached to depending on eachother, maybe it's worth something
- That's interesting... I still don't understand why you won't give me a chance though
- Well, I didn't expect you to, if I'm being honest. Though I hoped you wouldn't get too offended to make saying our goodbyes too awkward, or at least we could've agreed to not even look at eachother once we part ways
- You'll end up alone if you keep waiting for the perfect person to just show up and stay on your side forever with you not even trying to see if someone is good enough for you
- That's fine, I've come to accept that. I did find her once, but she's long left. And actually, speaking of that, this is my bus stop.
